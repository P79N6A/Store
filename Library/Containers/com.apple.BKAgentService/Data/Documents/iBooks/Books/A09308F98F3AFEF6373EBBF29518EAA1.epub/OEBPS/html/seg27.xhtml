<h1 class="segment-section">Section 3: My Locations</h1>

<p>With this third section and the <i>MyLocations</i> app, you get into Swift programming in earnest.
</p>
<p>Sure you&apos;ve already done coding in the previous two sections, but this section starts off with a good review of all the Swift coding principles you&apos;ve learned so far and adds to it by introducing some new concepts too.
</p>
<p>In addition to that, you learn about using GPS coordinates, displaying data on maps, and using the iOS image picker to take photos using your camera or to pick existing images from your photo album. There&apos;s a lot of valuable general information on Swift development as well as specific information about building location-aware apps.
