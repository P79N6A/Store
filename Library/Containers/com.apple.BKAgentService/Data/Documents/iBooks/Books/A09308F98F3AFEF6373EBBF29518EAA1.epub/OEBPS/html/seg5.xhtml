<h1 class="segment-section">Section 1: Getting Started</h1>

<p>This section introduces you to the first of the four apps you&apos;ll build over the course of this book - <i>Bull&apos;s Eye</i>.
</p>
<p>As you progress through building the Bull&apos;s Eye app, the section will teach you how to think like a programmer and how to plan your programming tasks. In addition, you&apos;ll also learn how to use Xcode, Interface Builder and even the basics of coding for iOS.
</p>
<p>While some of the concepts in this section might seem a bit basic, please do not skip this section if you are new to iOS development - you will learn some fundamentals which act as the building blocks for what you learn later.
