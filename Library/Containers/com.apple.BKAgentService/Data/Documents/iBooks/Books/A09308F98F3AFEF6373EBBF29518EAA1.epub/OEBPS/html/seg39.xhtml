<h1 class="segment-section">Section 4: Store Search</h1>

<p>The final section of the book covers iPad support in more detail via the <i>StoreSearch</i> app. <i>StoreSearch</i> shows you how to have separate custom screens both for specific orientations (landscape vs. portrait) as well as for specific platforms (iPhone vs. iPad). This section covers networking, working with remote API endpoints to fetch data needed by your app, and how to parse the fetched data.
</p>
<p>If that wasn&apos;t enough, this section also takes you through the full application life cycle - from developing the code, testing it, and all the way to submitting to Apple. So don&apos;t skip this section thinking that you know all about iOS development after the last few sections!
