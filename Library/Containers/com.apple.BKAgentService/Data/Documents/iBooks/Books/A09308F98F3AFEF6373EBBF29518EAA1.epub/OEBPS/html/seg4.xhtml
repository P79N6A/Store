<h2 class="segment-team-bios">About the cover</h2>

<p>Striped dolphins live to about 55-60 years of age, can travel in pods numbering in the thousands and can dive to depths of 700 m to feed on fish, cephalopods and crustaceans. Baby dolphins don&apos;t sleep for a full a month after they’re born. That puts two or three sleepless nights spent debugging code into perspective, doesn&apos;t it?
