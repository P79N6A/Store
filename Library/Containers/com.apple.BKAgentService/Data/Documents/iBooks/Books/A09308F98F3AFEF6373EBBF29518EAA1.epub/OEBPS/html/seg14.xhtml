<h1 class="segment-section">Section 2: Checklists</h1>

<p>This section builds upon what you learnt in the previous section by introducing you to your second app. <i>Checklists</i> takes you from a single-screen app to a multi-screen app where you learn the concepts of navigation flow, displaying data lists, and the idea of modeling and persisting your data.
</p>
<p>If you want to build any sort of list-based iOS app, this section is a good starting point for learning the basics. Of course, even if you aren&apos;t building a list-based app, this section has some basic concepts such as handling the navigation flow from one screen to another (and back again) that would be very useful to an apprentice iOS developer.
